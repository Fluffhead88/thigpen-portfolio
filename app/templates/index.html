          <h1>About Me</h1>
          <p>I am a Web and Software Developer who specializes in finding solutions to fit needs and grow personal and professional brands, human-to-human. After spending nearly a decade working in business management and
            running a multimillion dollar retail store, I knows what truly drives successful businesses, and how to find real world solutions in todayâ€™s work environments. Since then, I've spent several years learning the latest technologies employed
            in web and software development with a strong full stack skillset.</p>
          <p>I'm also a professional musician who has been performing and working around the Southeast for 15+ years. My experience as a creative artist brings a unique eye and approach to composing and arranging solutions as well as the ability to
            pivot and be flexible when change is present.</p>
          <p>I hold a Bachelor of Arts in audio technology and a minor in business administration from Clemson University and a Carolina Code School Immersive 12 Week Full Stack Certificate.</p>
